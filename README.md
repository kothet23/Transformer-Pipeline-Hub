# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face Transformer Pipelines with Streamlit UI

This project provides an interactive **Streamlit web application** that demonstrates various **Hugging Face Transformers pipelines** using PyTorch (`framework='pt'`). The app offers an easy-to-use interface to explore powerful Natural Language Processing (NLP) models such as sentiment analysis, text generation, translation, and more.

## ðŸš€ Features

With this app, you can interactively try the following NLP tasks:

- **Sentiment Analysis** â€” Understand the sentiment (positive/negative) of a text.

## Powered by Hugging Face Pipelines

Each task is powered by the `transformers.pipeline()` interface:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
result = classifier("I love Streamlit and Transformers!")
